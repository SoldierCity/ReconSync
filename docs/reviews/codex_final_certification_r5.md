# Sentinel Protocol Documentation – Final Certification Audit (R5)

## Certification Table

Metric | Target Score | Final Verified Score | Remaining Gaps (if any) | Certification Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Overall Quality | 100 | 0 | Required R4 source materials and implementation updates are missing from the repository. | Unable to verify any of Claude's reported actions because the prerequisite review files are absent.
Technical Soundness | 100 | 0 | No access to requirements, design overview, or roadmap updates to audit technical coherence. | Implementation evidence is unavailable; technical assertions remain unverified.
Business Viability | 100 | 0 | Business alignment documents (requirements, roadmap) are not present. | Cannot validate prioritization, sequencing, or stakeholder alignment claims.
Documentation Quality | 100 | 0 | Core documentation set and R4 review artifacts are missing. | Documentation set is incomplete, preventing quality or compliance checks.

## Summary of Verification Results
- Attempted to open the R4 review files (`docs/reviews/codex_gap_analysis_to_100pct_r4.md` and `docs/reviews/claude_gap_analysis_implementation_r4.md`), but neither file exists in the repository, so no R4 recommendations could be cross-checked.
- Core source documents (`docs/requirements.md`, `docs/design_overview.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`) are also absent, eliminating the ability to confirm any claimed implementations or traceability links.
- Because the underlying evidence is missing, all evaluation metrics remain uncertified and the documentation set cannot be approved. Restoring the full R4 documentation package is required before certification can proceed.

## Final Verdict
⚠️ Partial Certification – Revisions Required (missing R4 review artifacts and core documentation set)
