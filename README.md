# ReconSync

https://github.com/SoldierCity/ReconSync

**ReconSync** is a modular, Discord-integrated bot-agent system for backing up and monitoring dedicated game servers like  **ARK: Survival Ascended**, **Rust**, and **Valheim**.

It enables server admins to manage scheduled backups, monitor server health, and receive Discord alerts — all through simple slash commands.

---

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
- ✅ Slash-command interface via Discord:
  - `/status`, `/backup now`, `/uptime`, `/alerts enable`
- ✅ Agent-based monitoring and backups
- ✅ Cron-based scheduling and retention config
- ✅ Server health alerts in Discord
- ✅ YAML-based per-server config files
- ✅ Supports Linux & Windows game servers

---

## Supported Games

- ARK: Survival Ascended
- Rust
- Valheim *(experimental)*

> Additional games (e.g., 7DTD, Minecraft) are planned for Phase 7.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Discord Bot**: Handles slash commands and permissions
- **Recon Agent**: Runs on each game server; performs backups and sends alerts
- **YAML Config**: Game-specific configuration (backup schedule, monitor rules)
- **REST Protocol**: Bot-Agent communication using secure tokens
