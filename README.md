[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
> **Built With**: `discord.py`, `FastAPI`, `httpx`, `PyYAML`, `pydantic`, `APScheduler`

https://github.com/SoldierCity/ReconSync

**ReconSync** is a modular, Discord-integrated bot-agent system for backing up and monitoring dedicated game servers like  **ARK: Survival Ascended**, **Rust**, and **Valheim**.

It enables server admins to manage scheduled backups, monitor server health, and receive Discord alerts â€” all through simple slash commands.

---

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
- âœ… Slash-command interface via Discord:
  - `/status`, `/backup now`, `/uptime`, `/alerts enable`
- âœ… Agent-based monitoring and backups
- âœ… Cron-based scheduling and retention config
- âœ… Server health alerts in Discord
- âœ… YAML-based per-server config files
- âœ… Supports Linux & Windows game servers
> Built using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/)

---

## Supported Games

- ARK: Survival Ascended
- Rust
- Valheim *(experimental)*

> Additional games (e.g., 7DTD, Minecraft) are planned for Phase 7.

---

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

To self-host ReconSync, clone this repo and configure your environment using the templates in `.env.example` and `games/*.yaml`.

> Full setup instructions coming soon in [`docs/user/`](docs/user/)

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Discord Bot**: Handles slash commands and permissions
- **Recon Agent**: Runs on each game server; performs backups and sends alerts
- **YAML Config**: Game-specific configuration (backup schedule, monitor rules)
- **REST Protocol**: Bot-Agent communication using secure tokens
